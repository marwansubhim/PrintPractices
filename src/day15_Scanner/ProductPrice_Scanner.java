Cost can be calculated as the selling price of the product times the quantity sold,
 i.e. Cost price Ã— quantity. Write a program that asks the user to enter product price and
 quantity and then calculate the Cost. If the Cost is more than 5000 a discount is 10% offered.
 Program should display the discount and discounted Cost.
    Ex: 100, 3 -> 300 --> Cost: 300, Discount: 0%
    Ex: 100, 60 -> 6000 -> Cost: 5400, Discount: 10%
